# Cinema

A thing to watch videos at the same time as other people

## Cinema Viewer

Serves a folder full of HLS-encoded media files with a web frontend to watch them together with friends, in-sync, with a built-in chat room ([Docs](./cinema/README.md))

## Cinema Encoder

Monitors a folder for new video files and encodes them into HLS format with metadata for use with Cinema Viewer ([Docs](./encode/README.md))
